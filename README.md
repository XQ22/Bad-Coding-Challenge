# Purpose of these files

[The Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvjgXvBlbQiydffZU7m1_aw) is a Youtube Channel that produces videos with coding challenges.

These files are my attempt to solve those challenges in as esoteric and/or inefficient a way as possible, inspired by the subreddit [/r/badcode](https://reddit.com/r/badcode).

## Rules I will be using

1. No if statements. There exists no further evil than including if statements in your code.
2. Use Python. Using Python, making bad code becomes a challenge.
3. Only Finished work will be published to the Master Branch.
4. No use of the Python class structure is permitted.

## Completed Challenges

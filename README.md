# Purpose of these files

[The Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvjgXvBlbQiydffZU7m1_aw) is a Youtube Channel that produces videos with coding challenges.

These files are my attempt to solve those challenges in as esoteric and/or inefficient a way as possible, inspired by the subreddits [/r/badcode](https://reddit.com/r/badcode) and [/r/shittyprogramming](https://reddit.com/r/shittyprogramming).

Naturally, the products of bad coding will be different from the products of sensible coding.

## Rules I will be using

1. No if statements. There exists no further evil than including if statements in your code.
2. Use Python. Using Python, making bad code becomes a challenge.
3. Only Finished work will be published to the Master Branch. Later updates can still be made
4. No use of the Python class structure is permitted.
5. No looking at the good code videos before making bad code. To find the requirements of the code, I'll use the "see it live" feature on the [Coding Train website](https://thecodingtrain.com/CodingChallenges/)
